1: Assumptions and Methods

     Everything in this document was based on game version 1.4.1.

     All Costs/Building footprint info comes straight from the game.  The
     overlap area is still considered part of the building, since not all
     buildings can overlap effectively.

     All industries where laid out optimally for their specific requirements,
     unless otherwise noted.

     All factors that may influence productivity where removed/reduced as much
     as possible.  The church, fair and joust are some examples of things that
     effect productivity.  The tests which didn't involve gong and crime where
     run on a custom map with these factors turned off, so as to prevent them
     from becoming an issue.

     In a few instances, the numbers where slightly skewed to make the math
     come out nice and clean.  An example would be the food consumption rates
     below.  This is always rounded on the side of caution, so as to avoid
     production shortages.

     Where Possible, the result is shown first, with data and math following.

     All statistics are presented in such a fashion where higher is better.

     During actual game play, there is a myriad of factors that will influence
     production, and so the numbers below should be taken simply as a starting
     place.  For example, if your wheat farms are not producing enough wheat to
     keep your mill busy at all times, add a wheat farm.



2: Food

     2.01 Consumption
          Important Notes:

               I had been getting very inconsistent results in this area, with
               consumption on normal rations ranging from 0.8 to 2.5
               food/year/peasant, depending on the map.  After further testing,
               I thought that the correlation was that the troops where in fact
               eating as well.  This could be simply demonstrated by loading a
               developed castle, disbanding your whole army, and noting that
               food consumption did not change.  Further testing debunked this
               however.  More specifically, I disbanded 10 soldiers on a small
               test castle with a population of 24 and the food consumption
               rate was altered with the new higher population, confusing the
               hell out of me.

               After a whole lot of trial and error, I have come to the
               definitive conclusion that the amount of food peasants eat is
               actually a scaling consumption rate.  For some reason, when you
               just have a handful of peasants, each peasant eats several times
               the amount of food they would eat if your population where at
               200 peasants.  The practical effect of this is that food
               consumption plateaus when your population is around 128.  Your
               peasants just won't eat any more food no matter how many huts
               you add.  In fact, they will eat *less* if you add more huts.
               Perhaps this is an attempt to make it easier to manage larger
               cities, harder to mange smaller towns, or even an attempt to
               imply that the populace is getting more self-sufficient, and
               doesn't need the lord to manage their food so much.

               Women and children do not eat they're just eye candy, and have
               *very little* effect on the actual game.  Hostile military units
               don't even attack them.  The only effect they have, that I have
               noticed, is that they occupy seats at jousts, fairs, and at
               church.

               The lord and lady may or may not eat from the granary as well.
               If they do, their toll is practically incalculable as it is just
               too insignificant.


          As mentioned Earlier, food is consumed on a scaling consumption rate.
          For anybody that actually wants my calculations, the full math will
          be shown nearer to the end of this section.  The results will be
          shown in a handy table form here first though.  These numbers are
          rounded slightly, to make it a little more readable, and for safety
          reasons.

                         Food Consumed/Year
          Population     on Normal Rations
              8                25
             16                50
             24                75
             32                85
             40                100
             48                115
             56                125
             64                135
             72                145
             80                155
             88                160
             96                165
            104                165
            112                170
            120                170
            128                175
            136                175
            144                170
            152                170
            160                165
            168                165
            176                160
            184                160
            192                155
            200                150

          The game population limit is 432 peasants.  However, I have
          personally never built a castle which actually has that number of
          peasants.  Given that your campfire limit is almost always 23
          peasants (It can be changed in a custom scenario, but I haven't
          noticed a scenario where it was actually done yet), and the fact that
          space is usually too limited to actually supply 177 jobs, I find it
          to be a bit of a struggle to even get your population up to 200.  In
          any case, for populations past 200, it should be clear which way the
          trend is going just by looking at the table.  I didn't test
          populations over 200 very thoroughly, however if you load a saved
          game with a fully developed castle and a large army and disband the
          whole army, your population will jump up dramatically in most cases,
          while food consumption will remain unchanged.  I'm not positive, but
          I think there might be a hard cap somewhere down the line.

          I also did some checking to be sure that half, normal, extra, and
          double rations are in fact what they say they are.  Their names do
          not misrepresent themselves.

          On half rations multiply the Food Consumed/Year above by 0.5.
          On extra rations multiply the Food Consumed/Year above by 1.5.
          On double rations multiply the Food Consumed/Year above by 2.0.

          In the second granary panel, the game tells you the total number of
          units of food, along with how long (in months) this food will last
          given the current ration level.  I did check that these numbers are
          indeed accurate, and they are.


          And now my math.  If you’re not interested in checking my work, just
          skip it ;).

          To figure out a formula which would give food/peasant/year, I first
          needed some data points to plot.  To that end, I simply spot-checked
          several consumption rates by hand.  The formula to determine what the
          consumption rate is with a known population is:

          Units of Food in Granary / population / listed months supply * 12

          So, here are all the data points I tested by hand (I didn't round
          when typing this document, just truncated the decimals to the
          thousandths place):
          Pop
           8:  2684 /   8 / 1416 * 12 = 2.805
           16: 2554 /  16 /  683 * 12 = 2.804
           24: 2541 /  24 /  451 * 12 = 2.817
           32: 2526 /  32 /  363 * 12 = 2.609
           48: 2507 /  48 /  259 * 12 = 2.410
           64: 2470 /  64 /  213 * 12 = 2.175
           96: 2414 /  96 /  184 * 12 = 1.639
          128: 2334 / 128 /  175 * 12 = 1.250
          160: 2227 / 160 /  167 * 12 = 1.000
          192: 2147 / 192 /  161 * 12 = 0.833
          200: 2120 / 200 /  159 * 12 = 0.800


          Next, I fed these numbers into a calculator (a nice one), and used
          the quadratic fitter to calculate all the values in between.  It
          turned out very slightly inaccurate, but frankly, it's good enough
          considering the application.

          It came up with this formula, which again, I know is slightly
          inaccurate, but its pretty close:
          Y = 2.8537448367564e-5X^2 + -0.01742537197608x+3.1027277032641

          Which was used to generate this table:

          Population (X)   Food/Person/Year (Y)
              8               2.9652
             16               2.8312
             24               2.7010
             32               2.5743
             40               2.4514
             48               2.3321
             56               2.2164
             64               2.1044
             72               1.9960
             80               1.8913
             88               1.7903
             96               1.6929
            104               1.5992
            112               1.5091
            120               1.4226
            128               1.3394
            136               1.2607
            144               1.1852
            152               1.1134
            160               1.0452
            168               0.9807
            176               0.9198
            184               0.8626
            192               0.8091
            200               0.7591

          Multiplying the Population and the Food/Person/Year gives the final
          table:

                         Food Consumed/Year
          Population     on Normal Rations
              8                24
             16                45
             24                64
             32                82
             40                98

     2.02 Hunting
          Each Hunters Post generates 8.5 units of food per year hunting only
          birds.

          It would be practically impossible to reliably predict the amount of
          food brought in by hunting other game types due to their migratory
          nature.  I did watch a few hunters hunt deer for a while however.  My
          impression is that they actually produce *less* or about the same
          food as they do when hunting pheasant.  The amount of time it takes
          for the hunter to go from the hunter's post, to the deer he just
          shot, back to his post, to the granary, and back to his post again is
          just too much to make it look worthwhile.

          There is one thing to seriously watch out for when hunting however.
          Certain structures, mainly the stone structures, will block a
          hunter's shots when they're hunting pheasants.  When this happens,
          the hunters will have to start wandering around in order to get their
          game, which is very bad for your food production.  Be careful not to
          place hunter’s posts near buildings which are likely to have this
          effect.  The keep seems to be especially bad about this.

          10 Hunters hunting only birds and placed right next to the granary
          produced 170 units of meat in 2 years.
          (1065 - 895) / 2 / 10

          Statistics:
          Units of food produced per square of space taken up (2X3): 1.417/tile
          Units of food produced per number of workers: 8.5/worker
          Units of food produced per resources cost up (5 wood): 1.7/wood


     2.03 Apples
          Each Apple Orchards generates 32 units of food per year.

          Beware that apple placement is bugged.  You an already placed orchard
          can only be overlapped on its eastern and southern edges.  I know
          that there's no built in compass in the game, but pressing "k" on
          your keyboard will orient the screen with the keeps facing.  When
          this happens, the top of the screen is almost always north.  In
          practical terms, suppose you place 3 rows of 3 apple orchards using
          their overlap.  If the center orchard is destroyed, you will not be
          able to replace it without also deleting and replacing all orchards
          to its south and east.  In this example, you would have to delete 3
          more orchards to replace the middle one.  Given their cost and how
          quickly they start producing, this is usually not such a big deal
          however.

          10 Apple Orchards placed right next to the granary produced 640 units
          of apples in 2 years.

          Statistics:
          Units of food produced per square of space taken up (6X6): 0.889/tile
          Units of food produced per number of workers: 32/worker
          Units of food produced per resources cost up (5 wood): 6.4/wood

     2.04 Dairy
          Each Dairy Farm generates 29.5 units of food per year.

          Note that if tanners are killing your cattle, it will dramatically
          impact the amount of cheese produced and would make a reliable
          prediction of cheese output impossible.

          10 Dairy Farms placed right next to the granary produced 590 units of
          cheese in 2 years.
          (3447 - 2857) / 2 / 10

          Statistics:
          Units of food produced per square of space taken up (8X5): 1.356/tile
          Units of food produced per number of workers: 29.5/worker
          Units of food produced per resources cost up (10 wood): 2.95/wood


     2.05 Bread Production
          1 mill + 3 farms + 10 bakeries (called a bread block from now on)
          generated 280 units of bread per year. (3625-3067)/2

          The most important thing to understand about bread production is that
          the whole operation is centered on the mill.  Unmilled wheat is
          practically worthless, and bakers without flour are just a waste of
          resources and manpower.  In other words, the mill determines how many
          wheat farms you need, and how many bakeries you can have.  To this
          end, it's critical that the mill is optimally placed.  It should be
          placed so that the millers can beeline from the stockpile entrance to
          the wheat drop-off point and the flour pickup point.  Be sure and pay
          close attention to the direction the mill is facing.

          In an ideal setup, 1 mill supports about 2 wheat fields with a very
          slight excess of wheat production.  In actual practice, in your
          castle estate, you have the occasional gong pile killing the farmers,
          farmers turning to crime, entertainment, etc.  3 wheat fields fit the
          bill more correctly in this case, assuming that the wheat fields are
          immediately next to the stockpile.

          1 mill supports 8 bakeries, using the flour as fast as you can mill
          it.  Again, note that this was in an ideal situation.  The realities
          of playing the game tend to make this number slightly inaccurate.  10
          bakeries per mill tends to be more inline with actual game play.

          Units of food produced per square of space taken up (8X5X3 + 4X4 +
          4X4X10 = 296 squares): 0.946/tile
          Units of food produced per number of workers (3+3+10): 17.5/worker
          Units of food produced per resources cost up (15X3 + 20 + 10X10 = 165
          wood): 0.589/wood

     2.07 Conclusions on Food Production
          Just looking at the above, it's easy to see that bread is the worst
          overall method of producing food in the game.  Depending on how you
          set your economy up, bread is a good mid-late game honor producer,
          but it's probably too expensive and labor intensive for the early
          game.  A good option is to have neighboring estates produce bread for
          you, while focusing on more critical production items in your castle.

          Dairy is a great option for feeding your people, as it finishes in
          second place for every category.  On the down side, you have to
          severely limit the number of tanners around and it takes longer to
          start producing food than apples or hunters.

          Apples are very good as well.  They get started quicker than dairy
          and so production interruptions are easier to overcome.  At the very
          least, it is most definitely a good place to start.

          Hunting is pretty bad overall, but it has a huge advantage in that
          it's easily the most space efficient food producer. It's also easy to
          get going early on, but not as cheap as the 5 wood cost implies.

     2.08 Food Production Planning With Examples

          When eating multiple food types, the population eats food at the same
          rate.  The amount of food they eat is evenly distributed across your
          different food types.  The game doesn't balance their diets according
          to what you have more of in stock or anything.  If you wish to
          observe this, load a developed castle with plenty of all food types
          available and disable their food production.  You can then watch in
          the granary panel that they always eat one apple, then one bread,
          then one cheese, then one meat, and then loop.  This means for
          practical purposes, when you're building your food supply for an
          honor bonus, you have to be sure that you're bringing in an even or
          excess amount of food for all types.  If you don't the food types
          which have a shortage will hover near 0 in your granary, and the
          honor bonus will be inconsistent.  In my experience, this usually
          ends up translating to you building more hunters posts than you would
          otherwise like to build.

          Step by step:
               The first step in planning your food production is coming up
               with a reasonable population estimate for the estate.  This will
               tend to vary somewhat depending on the estate type.  If this is
               a kingmaker economy, you might want to reference the listed
               maximum population size per game discussed later in this
               document.

               Next, determine what ration level you wish to use in your
               economic plan.  If this is not your castle estate, you have no
               control over how much the AI feeds its people.  It tends to use
               double rations whenever their happiness falls, in order to get
               it back up.  Due to this, I highly recommend that you always
               plan for double rations in your vassal estates.

               To finally determine how much food needs to be produced
               annually, reference your desired population on the Food
               Consumed/Year table and multiply it by the proper ration level
               multiplier.

               Half ration level multiplier: 0.5.
               Extra ration level multiplier: 1.5.
               Double ration level multiplier: 2.0.



               The second step which needs to be considered in your food
               production plan is what your food sources will be.  Consider
               what sources are available (the more the better), if you desire
               an honor bonus, construction resources available, how much space
               you have to work with, etc.



               Finally, you have to determine how many of each structure you
               need to build to attain these goals.

               First, divide the required annual food production by the number
               of food sources to determine how much food needs to be produced
               or exceeded by each industry.

               Next, divide this number by the number of units of food each
               structure provides for each industry, rounding up.


               This can be summarized by using this formula for each food
               source.
               Food Consumed * Ration Level / Food Sources / Output of Source





          Example:
               For example sake, let's suppose that in our home estate, we want
               120 peasants to work with.

               In this case, let's say we just want normal rations.

               Suppose we want to provide our people with a steady stream of
               apples, cheese, and meat.  Perhaps we'll ship in bread from
               estates later for the honor bonus, but it's not an immediate
               concern.

               Last we use this formula to determine how many of each structure
               we need.
               Food Consumed * Ration Level / Food Sources / Output of Source

               Apples:
               170 * 1 / 3 / 32 = 1.77

               Dairy:
               170 * 1 / 3 / 29.5 = 1.92

               Meat:
               170 * 1 / 3 / 8.5 = 7

               This leaves us with 2 Apple Orchards, 2 Dairy Farms and 7
               Hunters Posts.  At least so long as they're all built around the
               granary in an efficient manner.  At the very least, this gives
               us a rock solid starting place.

               I have tested this, since writing it, and granary stocks indeed
               hold steady, with a very marginal growth rate.


          Example 2:
               Imagine you want to develop a vassal estate which exports iron
               to your castle.  It will have 6 mines (which are as many as it
               can fit) and 6 oxen to transport the iron to the stockpile.  In
               addition, you need 3 carters’ posts to ship it home.  The iron
               industry will take 21 peasants, and producing their food will
               take a few more.  Don't forget that their population has to be a
               multiple of 8.  24 (3 huts) is as good a population goal as any
               for this estate.

               We want double rations, to ensure their happiness is as solid as
               it can be.

               There is no honor bonus for providing more than one food source
               in an estate, so we just need one.  Apples are a good balance,
               so we'll use them.

               Last we use this formula to determine how many orchards we need.
               Food Consumed * Ration Level / Food Sources / Output of Source

               Apples:
               75 * 2 / 1 / 32 = 4.6875

               This presents us with a problem however, as there where only 3
               peasants slotted to find food.  Either we must change the food
               source, increase the peasants, or remove other buildings.

               Ok, so let's boost the population to 32, which will give a
               surplus of manpower, and switch them to dairy, just because we
               can.

               Dairy:
               85 * 2 / 1 / 29.5 = 5.7627

               So, 6 dairy farms and the problem is solved.

               Estate Bread (double rations):
                    A bread block will feed up to 72 peasants (9 huts) double
                    rations.  It will also feed 96+ peasants (12+ huts) extra
                    rations.

                    For reference, 1 mill + 3 farms + 10 bakeries costs 165
                    wood, 16 workers, and 296 squares.

               Estate Bread Exporter A:
                    If your intention is to export bread to your castle estate,
                    it is best to give the estate other food sources.  Giving
                    the estate one other food source cuts the amount of bread
                    they eat in half, 2 other food sources and they eat 1/3rd
                    their normal amount of bread, and using all available food
                    sources, they eat 1/4 their normal amount of bread.

                    Let's suppose we need 4 Carters and 16 bread producers for
                    a total of 20 workers to produce the bread and ship it.
                    With a population of 24 (3 huts), the peasants will eat 130
                    bread per year.

                    If you want to reduce this number, by providing apples it
                    will take 3 orchards to produce apples for 2 food sources.
                    Dairy farms can be substituted evenly here.  The peasants
                    in the estate will then be eating 65 bread/year.

                    If you want to use both dairy and apples, to reduce the
                    amount of bread eaten, you will need 2 dairy farms and 2
                    orchards.  The peasants in the estate will then be eating
                    44 bread/ year.

                    Finally, if you want to use dairy, apples, and hunters, to
                    minimize the amount of bread eaten to the greatest extent
                    possible, you will need 1 dairy farm, 1 orchard, and 4
                    hunters.  This means we do not have enough people, and have
                    to add a hut so that our population is 32 instead of 24.
                    After this change, we now need 2 dairy farms, 2 orchards,
                    and 5 hunters. The peasants in the estate will then be
                    eating 41 bread/year.  The extra effort and expense to
                    simply save 3 bread/year is dubious at best, but does have
                    the added benefit of leaving you with 3 spare workers in
                    the estate to assign wherever there is a shortfall.


3: Industry
     While the above section focused mostly on output vs. various factors, this
     section will focus on the balance of facilities.  For example, the focus
     will be on how many weavers should be built per sheep herder, rather than
     the actual output of a weaver. There will be guidelines for various
     production goals as well.


     3.01: Saw Pits
          In Stronghold 2, a woodcutter has to go between the trees and his hut
          only one time and then back to the stockpile to drop off his goods.
          So as long as the sawpit is somewhere between the trees and the
          stockpile, it just doesn't matter where it is.

          You may find yourself wanting to cut down specific trees or a group
          of trees first quite often, so it is important to understand how the
          AI selects which tree to cut down.
               A: It never goes to a tree that another woodsman is working on.
               B: It always goes to the closest tree, "as the crow flies,"
               which does not contradict rule A above.  This is important
               because if the guy has to walk around a whole mountain to get to
               the tree nearest to his pit, he will.
               C: If you delete a wood cuter who is assigned to a tree, and
               place a new one in a *very* slightly different spot, the new one
               may pick a different tree as the game seems to still think it's
               assigned for a while.

          If you want to remove a tree or trees very quickly simply because
          they're in the way, and you don't actually need the wood from those
          trees:

               Place one woodcutter/tree next to the trees.

               Give any still unemployed peasants jobs, even if it's just
               temporary.

               Once the woodcutters (at least mostly) each have a log either in
               their cart or sawpit, delete them.

               Quickly rebuild them.

               The peasants will turn back into woodcutters and get a new log
               without having made a trip to the stockpile.  With practice, you
               can use this trick to deforest a large area very quickly, but it
               requires a degree of micromanagement and costs 2 wood per
               woodcutter per deletion (usually 6).

          In stronghold 2, trees don't grow.  This means that there is a
          limited amount of wood on the map.  This can be a big problem in some
          maps (desert maps with limited trade are an extreme example), but not
          most.  If you played stronghold 1, you might find this to be a most
          pleasant change, as the ever expanding forests could cause problems
          in the first title.

     3.02: Stone Quarries and Iron Mines
          You can only place these on stone and iron deposits respectively.
          This means you have two options.  First, place your stockpile close
          to the resources, or second, haul the resources back home the hard
          way.

          Generally, I find 2-3 oxen per quarry to be a good balance, but it
          depends entirely on the distance from your quarries/mines to the
          stockpile.  I recommend that you start with 1 ox per quarry/mine if
          the stockpile is right near the minerals, two oxen, if your
          quarries/mines are about a screen away from the stockpile, and three
          oxen if they further out.  If your quarries/mines are producing
          resources faster than the oxen can pick it up, add oxen.

     3.03: Weaving
          Both weavers and shepherds need to be based near the stockpile.  The
          weaver only goes between their shop and the stockpile.  A shepherd
          goes to the flock once and the stock pile once for every sheep he
          sheared (usually 7 times).  A ratio of 4 Sheep herds to 5 weavers
          seems about right.  However:

          Sheep seem to wander around in a certain distance from the sheep
          farm.  This distance seems to ignore terrain.  This means that
          depending on your castle layout and the terrain, it may take the
          shepherd longer to get to the sheep and bring them back home.  When
          you have more herds, they seem to roam further than when you just
          have a few.

          If you're just wanting the cloth for dances, and not to sell, 1 sheep
          farm and a pair of weavers should be more than ample to supply all
          demand.

          If you want to export cloth, I suggest you start with an even mix of
          herds and weavers.  Then, if you are producing excess wool, add
          weavers until they are using the wool as fast as the herd can provide
          it.


     3.04: All Weapons Production except Leather Armor
          Your arms manufacturers go from the stockpile, to their workshop, to
          the armory, and back to the stockpile.  This means that production
          can be most efficient when the armory is directly next to the
          stockpile, and the weapons manufacturer is as close to the
          armory/stockpile as possible.  This is naturally counterbalanced by
          the fact that a very large portion of your industry also needs to be
          near the stockpile, but of course weapon production is very
          important.  If placing your armory next to your stockpile is not
          practical, the weapons manufacturers should be somewhere between the
          2 of them.

     3.05: Leather Armor Production
          Tanners work exactly like all the other weapons producers, except
          that they go to the nearest dairy farm with available cattle instead
          of the stockpile.  It may be to your benefit to build dairy farms
          near the tanneries in order to reduce the amount of impact your
          tanneries have on food production.  It also helps the tanner by
          shortening his travel distance.

          1 dairy farm for each tannery seems about right, but if your tanners
          are sitting idle, or raiding the dairy farms you want to be producing
          cheese and not leather for hides, dairy farms should be added.

     3.06: Pitch Rigs
          Pitch Rigs must be built on mashes.  If possible, placing your
          stockpile near the marshes can greatly increase production.  There is
          no way to improve production beyond this (like buying your peasants
          some shoes).

     3.07: Carters’ Post
          Carters should be placed as close to the border, in the desired
          shipping direction, as possible.

          Carters’ posts automatically ship whatever item the map designer set
          the estate to produce in lots of 40 units.  Unfortunately, there is
          no way to find out what this until you see it happen. It is usually
          safe to assume that estates with iron and stone deposits will
          automatically ship their respective resource.  If you watch what the
          estate AI built there, you can also make an educated guess at what it
          will ship if you do not tell it to ship something else.  For example,
          if the AI built dairy farms on the estate, it will probably ship
          cheese.

          There is no way to make the carters in vassal estates actually just
          stop shipping, except to remove the resource they ship.  The stop
          button just cancels the current shipment. If there are resources the
          post will automatically ship to you available, it will resume
          shipping as soon as the cart gets back to the post.  If you are
          worried about your main stockpile filling up with a resource you
          can't sell for some reason, an easy way to deal with it is to set the
          post to continuously ship 5 food to you, since your granary is
          unlimited.

          If you have a post set to continuously ship a product and tell it to
          send a single shipment of something else, without telling the post to
          stop first, the post will resume shipping of the continuous item when
          the cart gets back.

     3.08: Chandler's Workshop & Beehives
          Ideally, chandlers should be near to the stockpile.

          Chandlers go straight to the nearest beehive with wax available after
          dropping off candles, and then to their workshop. Placing your
          beehives somewhere between the chandler's workshops and the stockpile
          reduces amount of double back a chandler will do during his route.

          For every chandler's workshop, try 3 beehives for constant output,
          although 4 beehives are more practical if you only run one workshop.

          Each chandler is enough to provide for one level of mass at the
          church, as long as the chandler and beehive are near to the
          stockpile.

     3.09: Ale
          Since ale works just like candles, I'm filing it here, instead of
          under food.

          Use 2 breweries for every hops farm works well, as long as both are
          near to the stockpile.  In this case, one set per level of ale
          distribution desired seems to work well.

          Inns *don't* use different amounts of ale depending on the population
          size in stronghold 2.

4: Royal Foods

     4.01: Wine
          The vineyard should be near the stockpile while the vintners should
          be between the stockpile and the kitchen. It's going to depend on the
          distance between the stockpile and kitchen, but I find 3 vintners per
          vineyard to be about right.

          Also, 1 vineyard with enough vintners to keep the stockpile empty of
          grapes will provide enough wine to cover feasting indefinitely with
          wine to spare.

     4.02: Eel Ponds
          3 seem to be enough to maintain your current level of stocks if
          they're reasonably close to the kitchen.

     4.03: Pigs Farms and Vegetable Gardens
          2 of each seem to be enough to maintain your current level of stocks
          if they're reasonably close to the kitchen.


5: Notes on other assorted buildings

     5.01: Musicians Guild
          Adds to honor gained during feasting and dancing.  Always build it
          when you can. It should be placed near to the keep.

     5.02: Church
          If you're going to build this (hurts productivity when the peasants
          attend mass), be sure it's located near to the keep.  If the lord has
          to walk half way across the map to get to the church he will do so on
          a regular basis.  In other words, if your lord has to walk 20 miles
          to mass every Sunday, it cuts into his busy schedule of producing
          honor via other means.

          Simple Mass consumes 0.375 candles/month

          9 candles where consumed in 24 months.

          Standard Mass consumes 0.75 candles/month

          18 candles where consumed in 24 months.

          Special Mass consumes 1 candles/month

          27 candles where consumed in 24 months.

          Exhulted Mass consumes 1.5 candles/month

          36 candles where consumed in 24 months.

          Churches *don't* use different amounts of candles depending on the
          population size.

          All buildings which have multiple workers (the iron mine, mill,
          kitchen, etc) never leave work for this type of thing.

          Carters and ox handlers do not visit church.

          The church seems to be most likely to draw nearby idle people first,
          until the seats are full.  If your church is near to the houses, it
          will mostly draw women and children, and have a minimal impact on
          production.

     5.03: Jousting
          I used to routinely observe the lord attend the joust in one of the
          previous patches, and in that case, it needs to be built near the
          keep as well.  However, in V1.4.1, I have yet to see him actually
          attend the tournament.  Just to make sure it's not restricted to
          distance, I have attempted to place it very near to the keep, with no
          effect.  I also check that it isn't just low priority by stopping all
          the other lordly activities, just to make sure, and this had no
          effect as well.  In addition, I seem to recall, although perhaps
          incorrectly, that you would only receive an honor bonus if the lord
          was attending.  Now however, the lord does not need to attend to
          receive the honor bonus.  In other words, I really think that it's
          been bugged, to your benefit, in one of the last patches.

          All buildings which have multiple workers (the iron mine, mill,
          kitchen, etc) never leave work for this type of thing.

          Carters and ox handlers do not go to the tourney.

          The Jousting field seems to be most likely to draw nearby idle people
          first, until the seats are full.  If it is near to the houses, it
          will mostly draw women and children, and have a minimal impact on
          production.


     5.04: Fair
          I have never seen the lord attend a fair.

          All buildings which have multiple workers (the iron mine, mill,
          kitchen, etc) never leave work for this type of thing.

          Carters and ox handlers do not go to the fair.

          The fair seems to be most likely to draw nearby idle people first,
          until the seats are full.  If it is near to the houses, it will
          mostly draw women and children, and have a minimal impact on
          production.

     5.05: Treasury
          Putting a guard post and a couple of good units in front completely
          eliminates any threat thieves pose to your treasury.  In addition,
          enemy thieves cannot sneak through gatehouses.  If the treasury is in
          a walled location, it's pretty safe.

     5.06: Kitchen
          This should always be near the keep.


     5.07: Lady's Chambers
          This should always be right near the kitchen, wherever it is.  The
          lady makes use of the kitchen's pages when they are not serving
          feasts.  They help her bathe and get cloth from the stockpile so she
          can make dresses.


     5.08: Market
          Build this someplace out of the way, unreachable if you can.  No one
          ever has call to visit the market.  Also, this structure is free, so
          build it as soon as it's available to you.


     5.02: Inn
          When observing the inn, I have noticed that its distance to your
          workforce has no bearing on who decides to go to the inn.  To
          minimize the impact this building will have on productivity, be sure
          to place it near where you have your workforce stationed.  Workers
          without resources to work with (like a baker with no flour) are more
          likely to head to the inn than others.

          Only peasants which pickup, not drop off, resources from the
          stockpile visit the inn.  This includes bakers, blacksmiths,
          vintners, etc.  The sole exception to this rule, which I have noticed
          is the mill, which is because it's a multi-worker building.

          The ration level of the inn does not effect how often it is visited.
          Even if the ale is stopped, people still visit it and stumble out
          drunk at the same rate.

          Inns *don't* use different amounts of ale depending on the population
          size.

          Half Consumption consumes 0.375 ale/month

          9 barrels where consumed in 24 months.

          Normal Consumption consumes 0.75 ale/month

          18 barrels where consumed in 24 months.

          Extra Consumption consumes 1 ale/month

          27 barrels where consumed in 24 months.

          Double Consumption consumes 1.5 ale/month

          36 barrels where consumed in 24 months.

          All buildings which have multiple workers (the iron mine, mill,
          kitchen, etc) never leave work for this type of thing.

          Be careful about the inn, as the barkeep is the only happiness
          booster which will become a criminal.  If you're relying on that +8
          popularity bonus, it can be a very bad thing to not notice he's gone
          rouge.


6: Gong
     I've noticed that gong routinely seems to pop up in the same places over
     and over again.  Further testing reveals that it appears near specific
     buildings, and has nothing to do with traffic, population, etc.  Even
     without any peasants in the castle, gong will still be produced around
     these buildings.  These buildings are normally high traffic, but even if
     the traffic to them is stopped, the gong still appears.

     The buildings to watch out for are:
          Stockpile
          Armory
          Inn
          Granary

     Placing a gong pit near each of these buildings will basically eliminate
     gong as a factor.

     From hard experience, it seems that a single gong farmer can't keep up
     with gong production, so you need to have at least 2 of them.

     Gong farmers visit the joust and the fair, and church.  If you have built
     one of these structures, you may want to build extra gong pits.

     Gong farmers never turn to crime or visit the inn.


7: Crime
     If a building has been shut down due to the operator turning criminal, you
     can delete the building and rebuild it, and some jobless peasant will take
     over.

     When stealing food from a granary, a criminal takes 30 food.  If he
     remains uncaught, he will go back and forth between his house and granary
     constantly.  The time a criminal takes to do this is obviously determined
     by the distance from the granary to the hut/inn.  If there are no
     huts/inns for the criminal to go to, he sits in front of the granary and
     steals 30 every second or so, leading to a massive granary drain.  In
     other words, it's *very* important that you have at least one hut when you
     have criminals in your castle.

     The honor bonus for punishments works solely by the amount of time the
     peasant has spent being punished.  In other words, punishments which take
     longer give more of an honor bonus while the decidedly quick chopping
     block almost never gives a bonus of any sort.

     Criminals taken to punishment are always placed in the nearest available
     punishment.  If you have a chopping block and a pillory, with the chopping
     block being nearer to the courthouse than the pillory is, the criminals
     will always be executed.

     Unless you need the honor, there's no point in rehabilitating criminals.
     My best efforts to find out if a rehabilitated criminal will try again
     someday have shown that they do.

     If you have crime but are unable to build a courthouse, your criminals
     will obviously go around uncaught until you manage to get that courthouse
     built.  The game seems to be set so that there will be no more than 3
     criminals in play at a time by default, although this can be changed to a
     different number in a custom scenario.  When the scenario is set to have a
     very high crime rate, the maximum number of criminals is 5.  If you're
     willing to put up with the constant negative to your popularity, you can
     actually use this to your advantage.  If you build the courthouse and a
     guard post, and catch all the criminals without building any punishments,
     the criminals will just sit in your dungeon.  Since you're already at your
     criminal limit, no more will be created.  In other words, you're
     deliberately suffering a popularity hit for increased production.  If you
     have the chopping block available in your scenario, this is almost
     certainly not worth the effort.  However, if your scenario dictates that
     all you can use is the pillory, this just might be worth your time.

     All buildings which have multiple workers (the iron mine, mill, kitchen,
     etc) never leave work for this type of thing.

     Jobless Peasants cannot become criminals, despite the in-game help stating
     otherwise.

     Ox handlers, gong farmers, falconers, judges, torturers, guards,
     musicians, monks, and priests cannot become criminals either.

     If you have no peasants which *can* become criminals, no criminals will be
     created.  This is impractical as a solution to crime however, as all food
     related jobs (except the mill and kitchen), the treasurer, and all weapons
     producers can become criminals.

     7.01: Easily Catching Criminals
          When someone turns criminal, they *always* head immediately to one of
          2 places: Home or the Inn.  They are not catchable until they get
          there.  As soon as they leave their house or the inn however, they
          can be caught.  After a criminal leaves the Inn or Home, they always
          head to the granary to attempt to steal food.  If you know where the
          criminals will come from, and their destination, it's easy to place
          guard posts at either end of their route to be sure they're caught.
          Placing your courthouse nearby to where you're catching the criminals
          will aid the guards in their jobs as well.  One trick that can be
          used is to cluster your houses together, and surround them with a
          wooden wall to make a walled village with only one entrance.  Then,
          put a guard post or two at the entrance to be sure that no peasants
          get past you.  If you're using an inn, either place another guard
          post near the inn, or build the inn near the housing so it's covered
          as well.

8: Rats
     The effectiveness of your falconers is basically determined by how big
     your castle estate is.  It seems that the rats can appear in any location
     in your estate and go to any other location also in the estate.  For the
     majority of the maps I've played, 1 falconer is too few.  2 falconers do
     the job adequately most of the time.  In a particularly large castle
     estate, 3 falconers always do the job.

     Try to scatter the falconers posts around the estate in a fairly even
     distribution pattern.

9: Trade
     Here's a list of all trade goods with their market values:
          Food:
               Apples 8/4
               Bread 8/4
               Cheese 8/4
               Meat 8/4
               Wheat 23/8
               Flour 32/10
               Hops 15/8
               Ale 20/10

               Note that each unit of wheat yields one bag of flour which in
               turn yields 16 units of bread.  This means that per unit of
               food, wheat runs at 1.4375/0.5 and flour runs at 2/0.625.  It is
               much cheaper to buy wheat than it is to buy bread, as is
               expected.

           Royal Food:
               Eels 12/6
               Geese 12/6
               Pigs 12/6
               Vegetables 12/6
               Grapes 20/10
               Wine 24/12

           Materials:
               Wood 3/1
               Stone 4/2
               Iron 45/25
               Pitch 16/8
               Candles 8/4
               Wool 15/8
               Cloth 20/10

          Weapons:
               Bows 31/15
               Crossbows 58/30
               Swords 58/30
               Maces 58/30
               Pikes 36/18
               Spears 20/10
               Armor 58/30
               Leather Armor 25/12

10: Taxes
     All Examples just assume a population of 100 for simplicity sake.
     The results are always rounded towards 0 in the event of a decimal.

     Large Bribe +8:
          population * -0.5
          Example: 100 * -0.5 = -50 gold/month

     Small Bribe +4:
          population * -0.25
          Example: 100 * -0.25 = -25 gold/month

     No Taxes +1:
          population * 0
          Example: 100 * 0 = 0 gold/month

     Low -2:
          population * 0.25
          Example: 100 * 0.25 = 25 gold/month

     Normal -4:
          population * 0.5
          Example: 100 * 0.5 = 50 gold/month

     High -6:
          population * 0.75
          Example: 100 * 0.75 = 75 gold/month

     Extortionate -8:
          population * 1
          Example: 100 * 1 = 100 gold/month

     Cruel -12:
          population * 1.25
          Example: 100 * 1.25 = 125 gold/month

     Extra Cruel -16:
          population * 1.50
          Example: 100 * 1.50 = 150 gold/month


11: Using various happiness boosters to support taxes
     All examples assume that you desire popularity to be balanced against
     taxes.

     11.01: Food Vs Taxes:
          As an exercise in thought, let's consider producing enough food to
          feed your peasants double rations and selling the excess food,
          instead of actually feeding it to the peasants and raising taxes.

          As stated before, the amount each peasant eats depends on the
          population of your castle.  Maximum food consumption is 175 units by
          128 people. Since we're producing enough food to feed the population
          double, but are instead selling the surplus, we are selling 175 units
          of food/year.

          Further, as noted each unit of food is worth 4 gold when you sell it.
          Given that we are selling 175 food/year, we are making 700 gold/year
          on food sales.

          If you feed the food to the peasantry instead, and use the happiness
          bonus to tax them, you are bringing in 128 gold/month, which
          translates to 1,536 gold/year.  Even if you use high taxes, instead
          of extortionate taxes in order to provide a happiness buffer to deal
          with crime and the like, you are still earning 1152 gold per year.
          If you buy the *extra* food, instead of producing it, you will still
          profit very slightly (by 136 gold annually).  If you attempt to buy
          *all* their food, you will loose 1264 gold/year.

          Low Tax & Extra Rations
               Tax income = 384/year
               Income lost due to not selling food = 350 gold/year
               Profit = 34/year

          Normal Tax & Extra Rations
               Tax income = 768/year
               Income lost due to not selling food = 350 gold/year
               Profit = 418/year

          High Tax & Double Rations
               Tax income = 1152/year
               Income lost due to not selling food = 700 gold/year
               Profit = 452/year

          Extortionate Tax & Double Rations
               Tax income = 1536/year
               Income lost due to not selling food = 700 gold/year
               Profit = 836/year

          Clearly it is more profitable to tax the peasants and feed then
          double than it is to sell the excess food and feed them normally.

     11.02: Candles Vs Taxes:
          Next, let's consider selling candles vs. using them to provide tax
          income.

          As stated earlier candles sell for 4 gold each.
          Simple Mass consumes 5 candles/year which equates to 20 gold/year
          Standard Mass consumes 9 candles/year which equates to 36 gold/year
          Special Mass consumes 14 candles/year which equates to 56 gold/year
          Exulted Mass consumes 18 candles/year which equates to 72 gold/year

          Bear in mind that the tax income varies by population but the cost of
          the candles remains fixed regardless of population.  Even so, suppose
          you have a population of 128 for the sake of example.

          Low Tax & Simple Mass
               Tax income = 384/year
               Income lost due to not selling candles = 20 gold/year
               Profit = 264/year

          Normal Tax & Standard Mass
               Tax income = 768/year
               Income lost due to not selling candles = 36 gold/year
               Profit = 732/year

          High Tax & Special Mass
               Tax income = 1152/year
               Income lost due to not selling candles = 56 gold/year
               Profit = 1096/year

          Extortionate Tax & Exulted Mass
               Tax income = 1536/year
               Income lost due to not selling candles = 72 gold/year
               Profit = 1464/year

          For the sake of thoroughness, let's consider the option of buying the
          candles, instead of manufacturing them.

          Simple Mass consumes 5 candles/year which equates to 40 gold/year
          Standard Mass consumes 9 candles/year which equates to 72 gold/year
          Special Mass consumes 14 candles/year which equates to 112 gold/year
          Exulted Mass consumes 18 candles/year which equates to 144 gold/year

          Low Tax & Simple Mass
               Tax income = 384/year
               Candles Purchase Price = 40 gold/year
               Profit = 224/year

          Normal Tax & Standard Mass
               Tax income = 768/year
               Candles Purchase Price = 72 gold/year
               Profit = 696/year

          High Tax & Special Mass
               Tax income = 1152/year
               Candles Purchase Price = 112 gold/year
               Profit = 1040/year

          Extortionate Tax & Exulted Mass
               Tax income = 1536/year
               Candles Purchase Price = 144 gold/year
               Profit = 1392/year

          Clearly, using candles to offset taxes is very profitable.  In fact,
          it's nearly twice as profitable as using food for the same effect.

     11.03: Ale Vs Taxes:
          Next, let's consider selling ale vs. using it to provide tax income.

          As stated earlier ale sell for 4 gold each.
          Half Consumption is 5 ale/year which equates to 50 gold/year
          Normal Consumption is 9 ale/year which equates to 90 gold/year
          Extra Consumption is 14 ale/year which equates to 140 gold/year
          Double Consumption is 18 ale/year which equates to 180 gold/year

          Bear in mind that the tax income varies by population but the cost of
          the ale remains fixed regardless of population.  Even so, suppose you
          have a population of 100 for the sake of example.

          Low Tax & Half Consumption
               Tax income = 384/year
               Income lost due to not selling ale = 50 gold/year
               Profit = 334/year

          Normal Tax & Normal Consumption
               Tax income = 768/year
               Income lost due to not selling ale = 90 gold/year
               Profit = 678/year

          High Tax & Extra Consumption
               Tax income = 1152/year
               Income lost due to not selling ale = 140 gold/year
               Profit = 1012/year

          Extortionate Tax & Double Consumption
               Tax income = 1536/year
               Income lost due to not selling ale = 180 gold/year
               Profit = 1356/year

          For the sake of thoroughness, let's consider the option of buying the
          ale, instead of manufacturing them.

          Half Consumption is 5 ale/year which equates to 100 gold/year
          Normal Consumption is 9 ale/year which equates to 180 gold/year
          Extra Consumption is 14 ale/year which equates to 280 gold/year
          Double Consumption is 18 ale/year which equates to 360 gold/year

          Bear in mind that the tax income varies by population but the cost of
          the ale remains fixed regardless of population.  Even so, suppose you
          have a population of 100 for the sake of example.

          Low Tax & Half Consumption
               Tax income = 384/year
               Ale Purchase Price = 100 gold/year
               Profit = 234/year

          Normal Tax & Normal Consumption
               Tax income = 768/year
               Ale Purchase Price = 180 gold/year
               Profit = 588/year

          High Tax & Extra Consumption
               Tax income = 1152/year
               Ale Purchase Price = 280 gold/year
               Profit = 872/year

          Extortionate Tax & Double Consumption
               Tax income = 1536/year
               Ale Purchase Price = 360 gold/year
               Profit = 1176/year

          Clearly, using ale to offset taxes is very profitable.  It is not as
          profitable as the church however, and does hurt production more than
          the church if the church is placed properly.

     11.04: Food VS Other Sources of Happiness:
          If you look at the numbers established above, it is actually cheaper
          to have your peasants liquored up or religious zealots than it is to
          feed them.  In order to just run with this concept, we need to
          establish whether or not it takes more man-power, wood, and/or space
          to feed them as well.

          In the section on food, there are numerous plans for feeding your
          peasants.

          Since not feeding your people results in a -8 popularity, we have to
          have either the church or the inn working to maximum effect in order
          to offset this deficit.

          All comparisons assume that you're feeding 136+ people, which will
          feed any population.

          Space:
               The church takes up 98 squares.
               4 chandlers and take up 64 squares.
               12 beehives take up 24 squares.
               Religion takes a total of 186 squares.

               The inn takes up 42 squares.
               8 breweries take up 182 squares.
               4 hops farms take up 160 squares.
               Ale in total takes up 384 squares.

               Hunters posts, which are the most space efficient, would take up
               120 squares.
               Since we don't need the granary, add another 25 squares.
               Food will take a *minimum* of 145 squares for normal rations.

               Hunters Posts are very space efficient, if it where apples
               instead, this number would be 241 squares for 6 orchards and a
               granary.

               In other words, religion is *competitive* on the amount of space
               it takes up.  It's much better than apples, dairy, and bread
               production, but is worse than hunting.  Ale on the other hand,
               is far worse than even bread in the space used category.


          Resources:
               The church costs 50 stone and 500 gold (expensive building
               huh?).
               4 Chandlers cost 40 wood.
               12 bee hives cost 60 wood.
               Religion in total would cost 100 wood, 50 stone, and 500 gold.

               The inn costs 100 wood.
               8 breweries cost 80 wood.
               4 hops farms cost 60 wood.
               Religion in total would cost 240 wood

               6 apple orchards would cost 30 wood.
               20 hunters would cost 100 wood.
               A bread block costs 165 wood.

               Religion would be competitive on the resource cost if it wasn't
               for the stone and gold requirement, but it's not.  Ale
               production costs far more wood than even bread does.

          Workers
               Religion would need 1 priest and 4 chandlers for a total of five
               people.

               Ale requires a barkeep, 8 brewers, and 4 hops farmers for a
               total of 13 people.

               Apples would take 6 people.

               A bread block occupies 16 people.

               Hunters would occupy 20 people.

               In the manpower arena, it seems that religion is hands down the
               best.  Ale is competitive, as it beats hunting and bread
               production, but does not beat apples or dairy.


          In short, religion is competitive, if you have extra stone and gold
          to throw around, but are short on space and man-power.  Ale is only
          competitive in the man-power department.  Both ale and religion as an
          economic base fail to give you the regular honor bonus multiple food
          production does.


12: Conclusions on Taxes
     If you wish to absolutely maximize your gold intake, the most profitable
     course is to use the church and ale to offset the -16 tax penalty.  If you
     want to have a buffer of +2 happiness in order to account for crime and
     the like, the most profitable course is:

     Exulted Mass +8
     Extra Consumption +6
     Extra Rations +4
     Taxes -16
     Total +2

     Another option that will work well is to combine Exulted Mass with Double
     Ale Consumption, normal rations, and either the joust of the fair to
     provide an occasional extra happiness bonus.  This will keep your
     happiness in the 90+ range indefinitely, with a slight overall climb in
     the event of something dropping your happiness.  If your popularity
     suddenly falls, having this many popularity boosters makes it very easy to
     recover quickly.

               Cost: 1 Gold, 10 Honor

     13.02: Unit Hierarchy
          For the main units (those recruited from the barracks), it's pretty
          obvious which units beat which units on even terms.  However, when
          you throw in the units from the monastery and mercenary outpost, the
          picture becomes muddled.  In order to paint a clear picture, I pit
          each unit against each other in a series of 24 vs. 24 battles in a
          sort of battle royal.  Each engagement was surprisingly decisive,
          with 10 or more survivors on the winning side in nearly all cases.
          There where no instances of a unit being equally matched against
          another unit type.  The pecking order turns out like this:

               Peasants
               Spearmen
               Light Cavalry
               Pictish Boat Warriors
               Monk
               Thief
               Outlaw
               Macemen
               Warrior Monk
               Berserker
               Pikemen
               Assassin
               Swordsmen
               Knights
               Mounted Knights
               Lord
               Mounted Lord

          Note that some units have special abilities to be considered during
          actual game play, and I make no attempt to quantify them.  For
          instance, Light Cavalry suffer heavy casualties when fighting
          spearmen and all other regular units will simply best them in an even
          fight.  Their speed makes them most useful for certain tasks however,
          such as raiding an enemy siege camp before if starts pumping out
          siege equipment.

          It's also worth noting that assassins are only bested by swordsmen or
          better when deployed in equal numbers. Assassins are so expensive,
          however, that this situation will tend to not occur. In fact, they
          are more expensive than knights, and an equal force of knights will
          make short work of them.  Still, their abilities are most definitely
          advantageous in certain situations.

          While the lord has the single best combat abilities of any unit in
          the game, many units can overpower him with relative ease, since you
          only get one.  As a point of interest from a testing method that
          didn't pan out, a lord on foot can single handedly take on 43
          peasants at one time and win.  On horseback, he can take on up to 52
          peasants at once.  However, this says a little less about the quality
          of the lord unit and quite a bit about the absolute lack of quality
          associated with peasants.

          When knights are mounted, they not only get more health and improved
          movement speed due to the horse, but their attack speed is
          dramatically increased as well.  This makes mounted knights far more
          powerful than knights on foot.

          I could not identify a method of testing missile units which was both
          consistent and would finish within a reasonable amount of time as
          armored units take forever to kill in a controlled test.  However,
          each missile unit has its advantages and disadvantages, and for the
          most part, none should truly be considered superior to the others in
          the correct application.

          Axe throwers seemed to do the most damage in the shortest amount of
          time.  They also seem to be the best at melee.  They do have a very
          short range however, which limits their usefulness.

          Archers have a longer range and faster fire rate than crossbowmen do.
          This makes them more effective in general against weak units, and
          gives them an edge in certain defensive applications.  Crossbowmen do
          much more damage however, which is important when facing stronger
          unit types.  On the offensive, crossbowmen are slower than archers,
          which hampers your efforts, and do not have the range you need to be
          able to suppress fire from enemy towers.

          Horse archers are relatively expensive and cannot be put on walls.
          Their ability to shoot on the move and outrun practically everything
          make them very useful units however, even though they're still pretty
          ineffective against enemy armored troops.


     13.03: Military Conclusions
          The only unit spearmen can take on and win against is peasants.  They
          have a numerical advantage due to their low price, but note that
          monks are cheaper and beat the pants off of light cavalry and boat
          warriors.  The downside to monks, however, is that the monastery is a
          huge building which you will not always have the room to place.  Not
          to mention the fact that spears are very easy to manufacture in large
          quantities, which cuts the purchase price of the spearmen down.

          Consider that even the most advanced field armies need lighter
          infantry units to do certain tasks.  For example, due to their very
          low speed, swordsmen are not well suited to quickly gaining the walls
          and taking out a tower ballista which is harassing your units.  In
          this category the top 4 contenders are Outlaws, Macemen, Warrior
          Monks, and Berserkers.  When considering which of these units to
          purchase:
               Outlaws are the weakest of this batch of units, but their price
               is right.  They're nearly half the cost of macemen and require
               no honor.  Still, berserkers are only 33% more expensive and top
               this category of unit.

               Macemen are hands down the most expensive of this category if
               you purchase the weapons, or take a lot of manpower to field
               simply due to their extensive production chain.  To top it off,
               they're the second to worst in the actual combat category.  I
               find they can usually get to that pesky mangonel and take it
               out, but cannot consistently hold the tower against any sort of
               response.  This means that heavier foot units have to be Jonny
               on the spot to relieve them (which is not always practical), or
               you will often end up just wasting time and units because the
               enemy can rebuild faster than you can replace your macemen.

               Warrior Monks are surprisingly good at this role.  Their price
               is great if your economic build leaves you with honor to spare.
               Of course, the monastery takes up a lot of room.

               Berserkers are the best in their class in raw combat ability.
               They also cost much less than macemen and have much lower honor
               requirements than warrior monks.  The fact that the mercenary
               outpost takes up less space than a monastery and provides more
               unit types helps tip the balance in their favor as well.

          When fielding heavy units:
               Pikeman are the cheapest of this class of unit and theoretically
               beat all light infantry in an equal stand up fight.  However,
               they do this by wearing the enemy down slowly.  Their attack
               leaves much to be desired, and are unable to take anything down
               quickly.  Even fighting spearmen will take forever.  This often
               will leave them vulnerable to enemy missile fire and gives the
               enemy ample opportunity to bring up reinforcements.  Their weak
               attack also makes them more vulnerable to being overwhelmed than
               the other units in their class.

               Swordsman beat the pants off of anything which is not a knight.
               They're cheaper than knights, but not as effective.

               A group of knights will hands down annihilate anything that gets
               in its path.  This is doubly true when they are mounted.  They
               even get the ability to heal (to some degree) in the form of
               requesting a new horse after their current horse is killed.
               They are however the most expensive unit in the game, aside from
               the assassin, and this can cause problems for even the strongest
               economy.  When considering whether to field knights or
               swordsmen, consider that knights cost roughly twice as much as
               swordsmen do.  However, testing shows that when knights are
               fighting swordsmen, while on foot, have to be outnumbered
               greater than 3 to 1, in order to loose.  3 to 1 against the
               knights results in a draw, with both sides wiped out, in other
               words a strategic victory due to the fact that the enemy lost
               more money than you did.  When the knights are mounted, they
               have to be outnumbered closer to 4 to 1 in order to fight to a
               draw.  When the knights are outnumbered 2 to 1, mounted or not,
               they will simply cleave their way through the enemy swordsmen.

14: Kingmaker Population Limits
     When playing kingmaker, the population and army size limit for each side
     is determined by the number of lords.

     # Of Enemy Lords  Max Peasants  Max Army Size
              1            120            500
              2            104            433
              3            104            400
              4             96            380
              5             96            366
              6             96            357
              7             96            350

     Whether or not map size has an effect was untested.

     Putting all the AI lords in one team against yourself does not alter the
     population limits.

     Note that the listed max peasants is not a maximum total number of
     peasants, meaning that in a 7 player game, you can put 96 peasants on
     every estate if you so choose.

          Estate Bread (double rations):
               A bread block will feed up to 72 peasants (9 huts) double
               rations.  It will also feed 96+ peasants (12+ huts) extra
               rations.

               For reference, 1 mill + 3 farms + 10 bakeries costs 165 wood, 16
               workers, and 296 squares.

          Estate Bread Exporter:
               4 Carters
               1 mill
               3 farms
               10 bakeries

               With either:
                    A:
                    3 Orchards
                    Population 24 (3 huts)

                    B:
                    2 Orchards
                    2 Dairy Farms
                    Population 24 (3 huts)

                    C:
                    2 Orchards
                    2 Dairy Farms
                    5 hunters
                    Population 32 (4 huts)

     15.04: Industry Ratios
          15.04.01: Stone Quarries and Iron Mines
               1 ox per quarry/mine if the stockpile is right near the
               minerals.

               2 oxen per quarry/mine if your quarries/mines are about a screen
               away from the stockpile.

               3 oxen per quarry/mine if they further out.

          15.04.02: Weaving
               For Dances, 1 sheep farm 2 weavers.
               For Export, start with an even mix of herds and weavers.  Then,
               if you are producing excess wool, add weavers until they are
               using the wool as fast as the herd can provide it.

          15.04.03: Leather Armor Production
               1 dairy farm for each tannery seems about right.

          15.04.04: Chandler's Workshop & Beehives
               Three beehives per chandler.
               Four beehives if using only one chandler.

               One Chandler for each level of mass.

          15.04.05: Ale
               Two breweries for every hops farm works well.

               One hops farm per level of ale consumption.

               Inns *don't* use different amounts of ale depending on the
               population size in stronghold 2.

     15.04: Royal Foods
          15.04.01: Wine
               Three Vintners per vineyard.

               One vineyard if not exporting wine.

          15.04.01: Eel Ponds
               Roughly three are required if not exporting.

          15.04.01: Pigs Farms and Vegetable Gardens
               Two of each if not exporting.

     15.05: Market Values of Trade Goods
          Food:
               Apples 8/4
               Bread 8/4
               Cheese 8/4

               Hops 15/8
               Ale 20/10

               Note that each unit of wheat yields one bag of flour which in
               turn yields 16 units of bread.  This means that per unit of
               food, wheat runs at 1.4375/0.5 and flour runs at 2/0.625.  It is
               much cheaper to buy wheat than it is to buy bread, as is
               expected.
